# LeNSE

The repo for LeNSE is broken into subdirectories for each of the different problems. They have almost identical structure, with the main difference being which heuristic to use. There is also slightly more to do for IM, as we need to pre-calculate (sub)graphs based on coin flips to evaluate the score of a node -- details on this can be found in [Kempe et al.]([url](http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v011a004/v011a004.pdf))
